## Database Connection Note
- Never try to connect databse directly
- use try and catch or promises 
- and also use async await
- Here we have discussed two way to connect database
- 1st directly write connection in index.js
- 2nd write connection code on db folder for database connection and export it to index.js

## Installation or third party library

- express for backend, mongoose is ODM for operation and connection with database.
- dotenv secure mongo url and write port variables
- dev dependencies nodemon (detect changes automatically) and prettier for code formatter
- mongoDB atlas for database (free version)
